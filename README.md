# Overview

This project aims to retrieve the metadata generated by [dlt](https://dlthub.com/) during pipeline runs executed by [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org) and surface it via Airflow's [OpenLineage](https://openlineage.io) integration. This metadata should be viewable through [Marquez](https://marquezproject.ai).

# Project References

This project structure has been adapted from the Astronomer tutorial for ease of running Marquez locally: [Integrate OpenLineage and Airflow with Marquez](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/marquez/)

The dlt pipeline has been taken from their [Load Data from a SQL Database](https://dlthub.com/docs/tutorial/sql-database) tutorial, which loads data from the [public MySQL RFam database](https://docs.rfam.org/en/latest/database.html) into a local DuckDB instance.
